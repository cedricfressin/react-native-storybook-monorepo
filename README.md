## Requirements

- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) is used as package manager:

  ```sh
  brew install yarn --ignore-dependencies
  ```

  _Yarn [Workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces) make it easy to develop complex software as a monorepo consisting of several independent packages._

## Monorepo Structure

The application project is organized within a monorepo structure and consists of the following packages:

- **[App Package](packages/mobile)**: This is the mobile app itself and relies on other packages within the project.
